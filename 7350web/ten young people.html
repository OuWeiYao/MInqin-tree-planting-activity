        <h1>"Ten Farmers"———The Power of New Farmers in the New Era</h1>
        <h2 class="title">About "Ten Farmers" </h2>
        <h4>Ten young people founded a company called "ShiGeQinTian". 
            They are not ordinary teenagers, they are cultivators with dreams. 
            Ten young people rushed to harvest 142 acres of rice day and night,
            soaked drainage ditches in ice water, carried 30 tons of fertilizers with bare hands on rainy winter nights, 
            unloaded 4,000 pots of roses with bare hands, and were so tired that they suffered from alkali poisoning...
            With their hard-working hands, they turned a barren land into a home full of love.</h4>

        <h4>The ten Qintians have demonstrated the truth that "when people are diligent, 
            spring comes early, and when the land is diligent, the seedlings grow strong" with their actions, 
            inspiring young people to pursue their dreams and work hard. 
            The ten Qintians have conveyed positive energy with their actual actions and have become role models and idols in the hearts of young people. 
            In the future, I hope that many young people can be like the ten Qintians, work hard, forge ahead, and work tirelessly to achieve their life goals.</h4>

        <h2 class="title">“Farmers are prosperous, agriculture is prosperous, and rural areas are harmonious！” </h2>
        <h4>From the first season, you will learn about agriculture and participate in the entire process of crops from sowing, growing, 
            harvesting, to selling. In the process, you will encounter problems, solve them, and summarize experiences. 
            The first season can be said to lay the foundation.</h4>
        <h4>Therefore, in the second season, based on certain practical experience and technical support, Ten Qintian has taken steps towards agricultural science and technology development and helped farmers. A series of measures such as planting trees in the Minqin Desert, the 5.18 Ainong Day Forum, and purchasing the last strawberries from farmers have already begun Ten Qintian's responsibilities as a new farmer.</h4>
        <h4>In the third season, they began to use their power to help ordinary farmers across the country,
             seeing the vastness of the world and solving the difficulties of people's livelihood. 
             In this land, the diversity of agricultural forms and farmers' predicaments needs to be seen and solved. 
             In places like Nangqian where the natural environment is relatively harsh, infrastructure construction is also a problem, 
             so pay tribute to everyone who has contributed to this land.</h4>

        <h4>See the vastness of the world and solve the difficulties of people's livelihood. In the future, we will follow the footsteps of the ten diligent people to go to more places, see all living things, see laughter and tears, see love and persistence, and here, everything we see and feel is what we gain.</h4>
        <h4>Our attention is also meaningful.</h4>
